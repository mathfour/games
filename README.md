# Games I Made
My first foray into a game is the RPS (rock paper scissors) game: https://mathfour.github.io/games/rps.html

I'll collect other games here as I make them.

The next not-so-game, but still fun is the [Back To The Future QG Game](https://mathfour.github.io/games/back-to-the-future-button-giphy.html) (quotes and gifs)
